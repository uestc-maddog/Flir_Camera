##特殊情况
###contact problems
If it doesn't contact well, it may cause the following questions:
* The machine may restart over and over again, untill it has no power or you turn off it. It is caused by the SPI's pins contact fault or the power's pins or some other pins.
* The LCD may display distortion. It is caused by the IIC pins contact fault.

###Recovery of contact problems
You can try the following ways to recovery your device. If it does not work well, you can send it to MADDOG company and we can solve the problems.
* Pull out the camera and insert camera when the device is turned off. And turn on the device.
